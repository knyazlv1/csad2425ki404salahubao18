## Repository Details

This repository is for the **Computer Systems Automated Design** (CSAD) labs. The repository follows the naming convention `csad<YY1YY2><group><student's full name><student's number>`. 

In this case, the repository name would be structured as: `csad2425ki404salahubao18`

Main development branch: **develop**

## Task Details

1. Create a GitHub repository with the name `csad2425ki404salahubao18`, where:
   - **YY1** is the start of the studying year: **24**
   - **YY2** is the end of the studying year: **25**
   - **Group** is the student's group identifier: **ki404**
   - **Full name** is the student's full name: **Salahub Andrii Olehovych**
   - **Student's number** is: **18**

2. Grant repository access to the author/lecturer.

3. Create a branch in the following format: `feature/develop/<task number>`.
   For this task, I named the branch `feature/develop/task1`.

4. README.md file will contain:
   - Details about the repository and task.
   - Information about the student's task as per Table 1.
   - Technology, programming language, and hardware details for the next tasks.

5. Create a Git tag in the format: `<PROJECT_NAME>_<VERSION>_WW<YYWWD>`, where:
   - **YY**: Current year
   - **WW**: Work week number
   - **D**: Current day number of the week

6. Create a pull request titled `task1` and assign the lecturer as a reviewer.

7. After the reviewer approves, merge the pull request into the `develop` branch.
